#Pattern indicators are classic technical indicators like the head-and-shoulders. They involve detecting
#some pattern in the data and triggering a trading signal if found. When we are detecting these patterns
#with computers, these indicators are often called binary or ternary because they have two or three possible
#values, -1 (short), 0 (neutral), and 1 (long).
#Rule sets for these indicators are simple because they are essentially built in to the indicator. Practical
#rule sets including these indicators often combine or index pattern indicators along with other indicators.
