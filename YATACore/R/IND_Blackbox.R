#When utilizing machine-learning methods to generate stock signals, the outputs are often multidimensional.
# These multidimensional outputs easily interact with rule sets optimized to handle them but are most often
# not worth visualizing. Not surprisingly, these strategies tend to be the most proprietary and have the highest
# information latency when used correctly
