### Overlays

Overlays are best characterized by their scale. Overlays typically have the same or similar scale to the
underlying asset and are meant to be laid over to chart of price history. Common examples are the simple
moving average, Bollinger Bands, and volume-weighted average price. Overlays are commonly computed
as the average of something added to a deviation of some form, or the price of the asset added to a curve of
some form.

Rule sets often concentrate on the prices interaction with the overlay or the overlay’s interaction with
components of itself. Here’s an example: If price rises above the simple moving average, buy the stock at
market price.
